# K-Means and Clustering Analysis
  This project demonstrates clustering techniques on the "EastWest Airlines" dataset, implementing K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms. The goal is to understand the dataset's structure and evaluate the   performance of these clustering algorithms.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and scaled data using StandardScaler.
Clustering Algorithms:
K-Means Clustering with Elbow method visualization.
Hierarchical Clustering with Ward linkage.
DBSCAN for density-based clustering.


# Visualization:
Correlation heatmaps.
Pair plots.
Cluster scatter plots.
Performance Metrics: Silhouette score comparison for clustering methods.

# Dataset
The dataset is loaded from an Excel file named EastWestAirlines.xlsx, which contains customer data for clustering analysis.

# Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
openpyxl
